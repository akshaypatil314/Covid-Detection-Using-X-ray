# Covid-Detection-Using-X-ray
The uploaded 4 notebooks are represented work that I prepared for research on Covid-19 detection using X-ray images.CovidNet20 and DenseNet121 algorithms are used to classify Covid-19, Normal, and Pneumonia patients from x-ray images. Both the algorithm gives promising result on given model with 100% accuracy on binary(Normal, Pneumonia) data using DenseNet121 algorithm and 97% accuracy on Multiclass(Covid-19, Normal, Pneumonia) classification with ImageAugumentation.Without ImageAugumentation on CovidNet gives 98% on binary data and 99% on multiclass classification.
